| Version | 0.2 |

| Contract identifier | `gfsim-cxx20@0.2` |
| Language boundary | Same-toolchain C++20 source and templates |

## Purpose and authority

This specification defines the C++20 model-library contract targeted by ACIR
lowering and the deterministic runtime semantics of generated simulators. The
generated simulator preserves a structured hierarchy of modules, queues,
resources, processes, protocols, probes, and statistics.

Agentic Circuit defines the canonical behavior in this document. The runtime
may reuse implementation concepts and terminology from Linx `tools/model` and
DavinciOO gfsim, including `SimObject`, `Module`, `SimQueue`, `SimSystem`,
`Work`, and `Xfer`. Such reuse does not imply source, binary, trace, timing, or
cycle compatibility with either system.

## C++20 integration boundary

v0.2 is a same-toolchain source/template contract, not a stable binary ABI.
Generated code, the runtime, packet definitions, and component libraries MUST
be compiled together with a compatible C++20 toolchain and build definition.
The contract does not define:

- a dynamic plugin loader;
- runtime discovery or replacement of model implementations;
- a C ABI or cross-compiler object compatibility;
- ABI version negotiation or compatible version ranges; or
- runtime model configuration.

All structural choices, parameters, policies, capacities, bindings, validation
profiles, and instrumentation included in a model are fixed by generated C++ or
compile-time declarations. An implementation MUST reject an exact contract,
schema, or generated-code identity mismatch during compilation or static
preflight. It MUST NOT select the nearest supported version.

## Object model

### `SimObject`

Every runtime object has:

- one owning parent, except the root system;
- a compile-time-assigned stable object ID;
- a stable local name and canonical hierarchy path;
- a statically known runtime kind;
- statically selected lifecycle, Work, Xfer, validation, probe, and statistic
  operations.

Object IDs and hierarchy paths MUST be unique within a generated model.
Pointers and host allocation addresses are never observable identities.
Before the first epoch, static preflight rejects an invalid ID or any distinct
registry, hierarchy, or dispatch-table objects that claim the same stable ID or
non-empty canonical path. Reparenting a module refreshes every descendant path.

### `Module`

A module owns child modules and local runtime objects. Generated C++ creates one
class or template specialization per specialized ACIR module definition.
Ownership remains hierarchical. Scheduler tables MAY contain non-owning object
IDs or pointers, but MUST NOT replace the ownership tree as the primary model.

### `SimSystem`

The system owns the root module, exact global epoch, event scheduling, phase
barriers, termination state, and deterministic sequencing. Component-owned
resources perform their own arbitration; the system does not impose global
resource arbitration.

## Exact time and epoch

Simulation time is a non-negative, unbounded-in-semantics integer tick. A host
implementation MAY use a bounded integer representation only if overflow is
detected before it changes behavior.

The global epoch is the exact pair `(time, delta)`, where `time` is an integer
tick and `delta` is a non-negative causal-delta index at that tick. Equality,
ordering, scheduling, tracing, and wake decisions use this exact pair. Floating
point time, epsilon comparisons, host clocks, and approximate epoch equality
are forbidden.

The engine is a conservative discrete-event engine with cycle-equivalent
integer-tick semantics. It jumps directly to the earliest pending time when no
work remains at the current time. Components are not polled during skipped
ticks. Cycle-equivalent means that state and observations at integer ticks
match the specified synchronous model; it does not claim compatibility with an
external simulator's cycle definition.

Within one time tick, causal deltas are processed in increasing order. An
effect may schedule a later delta at the same time only when the dependency is
zero-delay, pure, stateless, and effect-free. Independent same-time effects MAY
be reordered only when independence is proven from static ownership and access
information. A traversal-order assumption is not proof of independence.
The runtime declares a finite maximum causal-delta count per tick and MUST
reject a work item or event whose delta is at or beyond that bound before it is
inserted. Reaching the bound is a failed contract result with diagnostic code
`max_deltas_exceeded`.

## Event-driven activation

An object participates in `Work` only when at least one of these conditions is
true:

- one of its declared input epochs changed;
- an event addressed to it is due at the current epoch;
- one of its process subscriptions woke;
- it has a pending commit; or
- it requested an explicit internal wake for the current or a future epoch.

Each input and observable committed value carries its exact last-change epoch.
The scheduler deduplicates multiple wake causes for the same object and epoch.
Idle objects MUST NOT be polled, and delayed operations MUST schedule their
`ready_time`; they MUST NOT decrement countdown state on every tick.

## Work, arbitration, and Xfer

### Work snapshot and proposals

All `Work` executions at the same `(time, delta)` read one immutable committed
snapshot. Each execution writes only to a private proposal buffer associated
with its stable object ID. It MUST NOT expose a proposal, provisional
reservation, or local mutation to another Work execution at that epoch.

Order-independent Work executions MAY run concurrently. The v0.2 reference
implementation is single-threaded, but the API and component contract MUST be
parallel-safe. A future parallel implementation given the same generated model
and trace MUST produce bit-identical committed state, trace output, statistics,
diagnostics, and termination classification.

### Deterministic local arbitration

After all scheduled Work executions finish, a barrier closes proposal
collection. Each owning component arbitrates its proposals locally. Explicit
policy values decide first. Remaining ties use declared stable keys, in order:
port index, instance index, hierarchy path or object ID, then canonical
transaction identity. Monotonic scheduler insertion order MAY be used only for
events already indistinguishable under the model contract.

Arbitration MUST NOT depend on pointer values, hash iteration order, host thread
scheduling, or Work traversal order.

### Xfer barrier and causal continuation

After arbitration, the Xfer barrier atomically commits all accepted proposals
for the epoch, including queue changes, reservations, protocol transfers,
process continuations, event insertion, statistics, and trace-source transfer.
A transfer occurs exactly once at this barrier.

Pure zero-delay evaluation may use increasing causal deltas to respect its
static dependency order. An Xfer state change is stamped with its commit epoch
but is not eligible as an input or activation until at least the next integer
tick. No causal delta exposes a stateful same-tick result.

### Stateful timing rule

A stateful object commits at most once for a given integer tick, regardless of
the number of causal deltas at that tick. Its committed output is eligible no
earlier than the next integer tick. A zero-delay declaration is valid only for
a pure, stateless, effect-free computation. Validation MUST reject zero delay
for queues, storage, resources, protocols with mutable state, processes,
statistics mutations, trace cursors, or any callback with observable effects.

## Static dispatch

Generated code constructs a static dispatch table indexed by stable object ID.
Entries contain typed or type-erased thunks with statically verified signatures
for the operations an object supports. The hot path does not require virtual
dispatch, dynamic type discovery, string lookup, or plugin indirection.

For contract epoch `0.2`, the generated/runtime C++20 boundary is the following
logical layout (the declarations in `gfsim/dispatch.h` are canonical):

```cpp
enum class XferPhase : uint8_t { Arbitrate, Probe, Commit };

struct DispatchRow {
  ObjectId id;
  ObjectKind kind;
  void *object;
  void (*work)(void *, Epoch);
  bool (*xfer)(void *, Epoch, XferPhase);
  void (*reset)(void *);
  bool (*validate)(const void *, ObjectId, ObjectKind);
};
```

Rows MUST be emitted in ascending dense object-ID order, with `row.id` equal to
the row index. The typed row factory MUST recover exactly the statically known
object specialization from `object`. Installation MUST reject a null pointer,
missing thunk, non-dense ID, kind mismatch, ID mismatch, or failed object
validation. For one immutable Work snapshot, the scheduler invokes all `work`
thunks in ascending row order, then all `xfer(..., Arbitrate)` thunks in that
order. For each scheduled row, `xfer(..., Probe)` reports whether Commit would
publish state without mutating it. The runtime rejects a second stateful commit
at the same integer tick before invoking `xfer(..., Commit)`. The arbitration
call returns false, Probe returns the pending state, and Commit returns the same
pending state after applying Xfer, identifying exactly which activation sources
committed. A Probe/Commit mismatch is a contract failure. Reset uses the same
ascending row order.

Activation adjacency uses canonical compressed arrays
`activation_offsets[object_count + 1]` and
`activation_targets[edge_count]`. Offsets MUST begin at zero, be monotonic, and
end at `edge_count`. Each source range MUST contain strictly increasing dense
target IDs. Installation rejects malformed, duplicate, or out-of-range edges.
After the complete Xfer barrier, each source whose Xfer thunk returned true
wakes only its adjacent targets. Because runtime rows are stateful, those wakes
are scheduled at `(time + 1, 0)`; no stateful result is exposed in a same-tick
causal delta. Multiple edges and wake causes for one target are deduplicated by
the scheduler.

A Work object may submit proposals to a different object. Such an object is
registered as a commit participant for the current epoch. Arbitration and Xfer
operate on the ordered union of the Work frontier and commit participants,
sorted by object ID. An object commits at most once per integer tick.

Virtual functions MAY be used outside the hot path as an implementation detail,
but they are not part of the contract and cannot alter deterministic ordering.

## Queues and events

### Compiler-native queue links

`gfsim::QueueLink<T>` owns no payload storage and holds references to one
source and one destination `gfsim::Queue<T>`. Its Work method observes only
committed queue state and proposes at most one paired transfer per exact epoch.
The proposal is all-or-nothing: a full destination leaves source occupancy
unchanged. The two queues publish the pop and push at the same Xfer barrier.

The compiler must prove that the link is the source's unique pop proposer and
the destination's unique push proposer. Reset clears only link-local proposal
state and the `transferred`, `stalled_empty`, and `stalled_full` counters; it
does not alter either queue or its capacity.

`SimQueue<T>` exposes committed state and private epoch proposals. It provides:

- mandatory entry capacity;
- optional byte capacity using static `PacketTraits<T>` behavior;
- ordered read and write proposals;
- deterministic local arbitration;
- occupancy and watermark statistics; and
- protocol-aware push and pop endpoints.

An enqueue succeeds only if all declared capacities permit it. FIFO data queues
and time-ordered event queues are distinct types.

`tryRecv()` returns `{T{}, false}` when the committed snapshot is empty.
`tryPeek() const` returns a copy of the committed head and `true`, or
`{T{}, false}` when empty. `space() const` returns the number of free entry
slots the queue can accept this epoch — `max(0, entryCapacity − committed −
pending pushes)` — matching the `proposePush` capacity snapshot, and is `0` when
a byte capacity binds first. All three are pure reads: they never create a
proposal, register a commit participant, update statistics, or change the
last-update epoch.
Accepted queue proposals register the queue as a cross-object commit
participant. Queue commits activate only statically adjacent processes at
`(time + 1, 0)`; queue-readable and queue-writable subscriptions additionally
match the exact queue object ID. Pending pops never make capacity available to
same-epoch pushes.

The standard-library `Queue<T>` is the public finite FIFO component contract
over the `SimQueue<T>` primitive. The standard-library `Scheduler<T>` is a
finite ordered component. It admits candidates by unique `(owner_id,
transaction_id)` identity, selects capacity winners at arbitration, and orders
committed candidates by priority, exact issue epoch, port index, instance
index, owner object ID, and transaction ID. Lower numeric priority wins. The
issue epoch preserves FIFO order across commit barriers, and proposal insertion
order never affects arbitration.

An event contains `ready_time`, target object ID, event kind, payload, and stable
ordering keys. `ready_time` is an exact integer tick; a same-time event also has
a causal delta assigned by the runtime. Scheduling before the committed epoch
or addressing an object absent from the static dispatch table is an error. The
event queue orders by exact epoch, target object ID, event kind, and payload, in
that order.

## Resources

A resource represents finite service capacity. It supports proposal, local
arbitration, reservation, release, cancellation, and statistics. Its state
includes total capacity, active reservations, owner and root transaction
identity, issue time, and exact `ready_time`.

Each reservation has a globally unique transaction ID while proposed or
active. Proposal admission validates identity, owner, capacity width, and time,
but contention is resolved only at arbitration. Lower numeric priority wins;
remaining ties use port index, instance index, owner object ID, root transaction
ID, and transaction ID, in that order. Proposal insertion order MUST NOT affect
the result. Releases and cancellations are owner-scoped and cannot mutate a
reservation owned by another object. Partial release deterministically consumes
that owner's reservations in the same stable order.

Reservations commit only at Xfer. Completion schedules an event at
`ready_time`; no resource relies on countdown polling. Resource conservation is
a required validation invariant: the sum of active reservation amounts equals
the active-capacity counter and never exceeds total capacity. Ready reservation
queries use exact epoch equality and return the same stable order used by local
arbitration.
Accepted and rejected arbitration results remain private proposals until Xfer;
the previously committed rejection result remains observable throughout
arbitration and is replaced only at the commit barrier.

## Processes

Each lowered `ac.process` is a generated enum state machine. Its state contains:

- a program-counter enum value;
- typed live values crossing suspension;
- exact event or input subscriptions;
- termination or failure state; and
- any statically bounded continuation storage.

A process runs after an initial wake or a subscribed event, input epoch change,
or transfer. It executes until it terminates, suspends, fails, or reaches the
static fairness cap. It does not poll its wait condition. A process that can
loop without suspension, bounded progress, or a state change is invalid or
produces a capped-execution diagnostic, according to its static build profile.

Generated processes are final CRTP specializations of `ProcessRuntime<T>`.
Their hot step entry is the statically bound
`T::executeProcessStep(uint32_t, Epoch)`; no coroutine, virtual step dispatch,
`std::function`, interpreter, or dynamic continuation frame is permitted. A
step returns exactly one of continue, suspend, terminate, or fail. Suspension
commits a non-zero continuation ID, next PC, and exact `(wake_kind, wake_id)` at
Xfer. A wake resumes the process only when both the subscription and
continuation ID match exactly.

The generated fairness bound is the compiler-planned `fairness_work` value and
MUST be non-zero. Exhausting it commits process failure code
`process_fairness_exceeded`; an invalid zero continuation commits
`invalid_process_continuation`. Committed process failures propagate to the
system termination result rather than being reclassified as quiescent success.
Reset restores the entry PC and clears continuation, subscription, diagnostic,
and pending proposal state.

## Protocols and packets

Each bound channel has a statically selected protocol descriptor and
protocol-local state. The descriptor defines proposal, transition selection,
validation, and commit behavior. Validation can check legal transitions,
immutable pending offers, exactly-once transfer, credit conservation, in-flight
bounds, request-response correlation, cancellation, and timeout rules.

`ReadyValid<T>` admits at most one producer-owned offer. A rejected replacement
does not mutate that offer. Readiness and offers are private proposals until
Xfer; an offer remains committed and byte-for-byte stable under backpressure,
then transfers exactly once when committed readiness and validity coincide.

`RequestResponse<Request,Response>` uses explicit request and response
envelopes containing the payload and a `uint64_t` correlation ID. Admission
counts committed plus proposed requests against the static maximum in-flight
bound and rejects a duplicate live correlation ID. A responder may propose a
response only after the matching request pop commits. Response commit completes
that exact correlation, releases one in-flight slot, and retains the correlated
response until its consumer pop commits.

`ProtocolState` preserves `credits + in_flight == max_credits`. Request,
response, transfer, and backpressure phase transitions reject illegal moves;
leaving backpressure restores the exact prior phase rather than guessing an
idle state.

Every public packet type supplies static `PacketTraits<T>` behavior for its
exact ACIR schema identity, serialized size, maximum size, alignment,
endianness, serialization, deserialization, stable field reflection, and any
declared routing or correlation fields. Native layout may differ from serialized
layout. Offered packet values have immutable observable value semantics.

The C++20 `Packet<T>` concept requires `PacketTraits<T>::isPacket`, non-empty
`schema`, positive `serializedSize`, `maximumSerializedSize`, `alignment`,
`endianness`, ordered non-overlapping `PacketField` reflection, and optional
`routingField` and `correlationField` names that resolve in that reflection.
Fixed-width serialization returns
`std::array<std::byte, PacketTraits<T>::serializedSize>`; deserialization takes
`std::span<const std::byte>` and returns `std::optional<T>`. The runtime rejects
an input whose byte count differs from the exact serialized size before calling
the packet specialization.

## Component model-library contract

An external component is a C++20 type or class template compiled into the
generated simulator. It declares an exact contract identity and compile-time
interface. The concrete implementation provides, as applicable:

- static parameter, port, queue, resource, and address-map declarations;
- construction from a generated hierarchy context;
- lifecycle initialization and reset;
- Work proposal generation and Xfer commit thunks;
- process and subscription declarations;
- invariant, probe, and statistic declarations; and
- a static build profile.

`FunctionalPolicy` is an optional static template policy for functional
behavior. When omitted, the component's declared default policy applies. It is
never loaded, replaced, or configured at runtime.

Every executable baseline template exposes `contractName` and `componentKind`
as compile-time constants and satisfies the `gfsim::Component` concept. The
exact v0.2 identities are the matching `ac.std.*` catalog names; protocol
templates use `ac.std.ready_valid` and `ac.std.request_response`.

The generated build MUST fail compilation or static preflight if an exact
component contract, packet schema, protocol, policy, or generated layout does
not match. There is no compatibility range or runtime fallback.

## Generated hierarchy and introspection

Parent modules own children and local objects using members, `std::array`, or
equivalent structured containers. Instance collections retain indices and
element paths. Generated static introspection tables expose object kind,
definition and instance identity, ports, bindings, queues, resources, address
maps, static parameters, probes, and statistics.

## Trace source boundary

Only the trace subsystem parses PTO JSON. It produces exact-version
`PtoTraceRecord` values and decoded transactions. Compute, storage,
interconnect, and control components MUST NOT parse JSON.

Exactly one `TraceSourceModel` owns the trace cursor. It peeks the next record
and holds the decoded offer unchanged while downstream backpressure persists.
The cursor advances only when that offer commits at Xfer. Decode, retries,
Work reevaluation, and rejected proposals never advance it. Detailed identity
and dependency rules are defined by the PTO Trace Schema v0.2 specification.

The runtime `PtoTraceDocument` is move-only cursor input. `parsePtoTrace`
validates the exact closed `pto-trace@0.2` envelope into typed metadata,
records, operands, attributes, dependencies, issue time, and source location;
all failures use stable `ACTRACE-*` diagnostics and JSON Pointers.
`PtoTraceStream` accepts bounded chunks and applies the identical preflight and
decode path at `finish`, so chunk boundaries cannot affect records or errors.

`TraceSource<Transaction,Decoder>` owns the moved document and invokes its
statically selected decoder at most once for the current root offer. It exposes
the zero-based next-record index, last committed root sequence ID, and EOF
state. Acceptance is a proposal; only its Xfer commit advances the position.
Dependency-complete notifications accept only previously issued root IDs.
Future issue-time constraints schedule one exact self event and never poll.

## Static preflight and build profiles

The generated model selects exactly one static build profile. v0.2 defines:

- `fast`: every required representation verifier, static preflight, memory and
  time safety, capacity checks, protocol legality, unique identity,
  correlation, conservation, and fatal contract checks;
- `validated`: `fast` plus verification after every compiler pass,
  transaction-lifetime checks, deterministic-arbitration checks, address and
  dependency audits, full event provenance, and post-run quiescence checks; and
- `custom`: an explicit pass pipeline and instrumentation set that MUST retain
  every mandatory `fast` check.

The selected profile and instrumentation set are part of the binary fingerprint
and cannot change at runtime. Conformance testing uses `validated`.

Static preflight validates exact runtime, generated-code, packet, protocol, and
trace identities; hierarchy and object-ID uniqueness; bindings; address maps;
capacities; zero-delay purity; process bounds; dispatch-table completeness; and
all other statically declared invariants. No simulation state advances if
preflight fails.

Required runtime invariants include:

- queue entry and byte capacities never underflow or overflow;
- reservations never exceed resource capacity;
- each committed reservation completes, releases, or explicitly cancels;
- each packet or trace transfer commits at most once;
- protocol credit is conserved;
- epochs and event times are monotonic;
- stateful objects commit at most once per tick;
- correlations are unique and complete;
- address routing selects exactly one target unless multicast is static;
- stable object paths and IDs remain unique; and
- equal-priority arbitration follows the declared stable keys.

## No-progress and execution caps

The model declares finite caps for any fairness bound, maximum simulation time,
maximum committed event count, maximum causal deltas per tick, trace record
count, and validation traversal that it enables. Reaching a cap is not success;
it produces an incomplete result unless the triggering condition is a contract
violation, in which case it produces a failed result.
The scheduler does not jump past a time cap to a later event. It terminates at
the exact declared cap epoch and leaves the later event pending.

When unfinished work remains and no object is runnable and no future event can
wake it, the runtime reports no progress. The diagnostic includes blocked
objects and processes, subscriptions, queue occupancy, pending offers, protocol
state, reservations, next event if any, trace position, and available
dependency or correlation chains.

The runtime obtains diagnostic state outside the hot dispatch path and emits
blocked objects in ascending stable object-ID order. A committed non-empty
queue or scheduler, live resource reservation, retained protocol or trace
offer, active request-response correlation, runnable unscheduled process, or
suspended process is unfinished state. The report aggregates queue occupancy,
pending offers, and active reservations, preserves exact wake subscriptions,
and carries the trace cursor position and last committed sequence ID. An empty
schedule is `completed` only when this report has no blocked object and the
event queue is empty.

After the unique trace cursor reaches EOF, a process suspended specifically at
an `ac.yield_sim` `next_delta` wake is at a voluntary trace-end shutdown point.
The scheduler makes that process runnable at the next integer tick, where it
commits `Terminated` through the ordinary Work/Xfer barrier. Condition,
resource, and event-queue suspensions remain unfinished and cannot be converted
to trace-end termination.

## Statistics, replay, and determinism

Statistics and event logs are deterministic and machine-readable. Logging and
probes MUST NOT affect decisions. A run is reproducible from the generated
binary fingerprint, exact trace hash, and statically selected validation and
instrumentation declarations.

A statistic is a counter, gauge, or histogram with a stable local name and
owner object path. Mutations are proposals and become visible only at Xfer.
Counters admit additive proposals, gauges admit at most one set proposal per
barrier, and histograms admit observations into strictly increasing inclusive
upper bounds plus one `UINT64_MAX` overflow bucket. Arithmetic overflow rejects
the proposal without mutation. A `StatSnapshot` contains kind, scalar value,
count, sum, minimum, maximum, bucket counts, and exact last-update epoch;
fields not applicable to its kind are zero or empty. System snapshots are
ordered by `(object_path, statistic_name)`.

Host thread scheduling, pointer values, allocation layout, unordered-container
iteration, wall-clock time, and skipped idle ticks MUST NOT affect committed
state, output ordering, diagnostics, statistics, or termination classification.

## Termination result

Every run produces exactly one classification:

- `completed`: the unique trace cursor reached end of trace, all accepted root
  transactions reached their specified terminal state, and the architecture is
  quiescent with no pending commits, wakes, events, or live reservations;
- `incomplete`: execution stopped at a declared time, event, delta, trace, or
  validation cap, or by user interruption, without a contract violation; or
- `failed`: preflight, decoding, assertion, protocol, resource, dependency,
  timing, determinism, internal runtime, or other contract validation failed.

The run result records the classification, exact final epoch, final trace cursor
position, applicable cap, and structured diagnostic code. `completed` MUST NOT
be reported merely because the event queue is empty.

## Pure C++ requirement

The generated executable may depend on the statically linked gfsim model
library, C++20 standard library, compiled component libraries, and its selected
JSON parser. It MUST NOT require Python, MLIR libraries, an ACIR parser, the
Python frontend, or a dynamic component/plugin service at runtime.

## Acceptance criteria

The v0.2 contract conforms when it can:

- compile a generated hierarchy and exact component set with one C++20
  toolchain;
- build unique object IDs and typed static dispatch tables;
- execute the exact event-driven Work, arbitration, and Xfer barriers;
- jump over idle time while preserving integer-tick results;
- enforce zero-delay purity and once-per-tick stateful commit;
- schedule latency with `ready_time` and processes with subscriptions;
- hold trace records across backpressure and advance only on committed Xfer;
- produce bit-identical reference results under every permitted Work ordering;
- run conformance tests that deterministically permute or seed-randomize Work
  order within one `(time, delta)` and compare all observable outputs;
- enforce the selected static build profile and finite caps; and
- classify every run as `completed`, `incomplete`, or `failed`.
